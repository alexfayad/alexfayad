# Alexander Fayad

Software Engineer at [Confluent](https://confluent.io) · NYC

I build systems that move data and tools that should be free.

## What I'm working on

- **[dbex](https://github.com/alexfayad/dbex)** — LSM-tree key-value storage engine in Rust. WAL, compaction, crash recovery.
- **[opensourcethis](https://opensourcethis.org)** — Mapping software that should be open source. Highlighting what exists, building what doesn't.
- **MTA Buddy** — NYC transit app built on open MTA data. Real-time arrivals, trip tracking, service alerts.
